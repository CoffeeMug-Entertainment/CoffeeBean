# CoffeeBean

## What is CoffeeBean?

CoffeeBean is a 3D game engine with the primary focus on First-Person games.

## Features

* OpenGL Renderer
* MDF support


## How to build?

If you have installed [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), you should be able to run `build.sh`

## Dependencies

All dependencies are part of Odin's packages or available in `libs`

## Current Version: 

`2.0.0-alpha`

### Why is there a 2 in the version?

Because this is the second version of the engine bearing that name. [CoffeeBean 1 - Jezva can be found here.](https://gitlab.com/coffeemug-ent/cbe-jezva) After a lot of headaches caused by rewriting the engine, I realised it would be simpler and faster to just begin anew.
